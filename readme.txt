== Description ==
[DEMO](http://www.couponsindemand.com/blog/wordpress/) - Displays sample coupons from our "Agency" demo account

COUPONS IN DEMAND makes it simple for businesses and marketing agencies to [make coupons online](http://www.couponsindemand.com/) and display coupons on their existing business website. If applicable, the business can specify multiple locations where the coupons may redeemed.  Also, you may enable the social sharing option to help make your offers go viral.

The COUPONS IN DEMAND plugin allows you to easily display the coupons that you create for your business on [CouponsInDemand.com](http://www.couponsindemand.com/).

If you're a small startup on a budget, we have plans starting as low as $10/month.  However, if you want to first test drive this plugin, go ahead and install it; by default our plugin connects to our [sample coupons](http://sample.CouponsInDemand.com/).
Once you create your own account, you can then change the plugin's settings to connect to your account.
